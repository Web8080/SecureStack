# SecureStack

## Project Name
**SecureStack**

## Tagline
"Ship secure code without slowing down"

## Description

SecureStack is a unified DevSecOps platform designed for engineering teams who need to integrate security into their development workflow without compromising velocity. It combines four essential security capabilities into a single, easy-to-integrate service that can be deployed on-premises or connected via API.

## Value Proposition

Instead of managing multiple security tools, SecureStack provides:
- **One Platform**: Four critical DevSecOps capabilities in a single service
- **Easy Integration**: REST APIs and client libraries for any tech stack
- **Production Ready**: Built for real-world use with proper error handling, logging, and scalability
- **Minimal Dependencies**: 99% self-contained with only free public APIs for vulnerability data

## Target Audience

- Software engineering teams building web applications
- DevOps engineers implementing security automation
- Security teams needing integrated tooling
- Organizations requiring compliance automation

## Key Differentiators

1. **Unified Platform**: Not a collection of tools, but a cohesive security stack
2. **Developer-Friendly**: Designed to fit into existing workflows, not replace them
3. **Production-Grade**: Built with enterprise requirements in mind
4. **Open Architecture**: REST APIs allow integration with any CI/CD pipeline

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Policy Engine**: Open Policy Agent (OPA)
- **SBOM Format**: CycloneDX
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose

## Modules

### 1. API Security Testing
Automated security testing for REST APIs including contract validation, fuzzing, and rate limiting checks.

### 2. Compliance-as-Code
Policy-driven compliance automation with support for SOC 2, PCI-DSS, and GDPR frameworks.

### 3. Dependency Management
Intelligent risk scoring and vulnerability assessment for application dependencies.

### 4. SBOM Generation
Automated Software Bill of Materials generation with cryptographic attestation support.
